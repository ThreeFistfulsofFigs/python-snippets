# Python Snippets Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of standalone Python code snippets for various tasks, including CAPTCHA generation, WHOIS lookups, text-to-speech conversion, and data visualization. Each snippet is designed to be modular, serving as a quick reference or starting point for development projects.

## Contents

The repository includes the following Python snippets:

- **1__Image_captcha_generator.py**: Generates visual CAPTCHA images from user-provided text using the `captcha` library, useful for bot prevention in web applications.
- **2__Querying_WHOIS_Information.py**: Retrieves and displays WHOIS information for IP addresses using the `ipwhois` library, supporting both single and batch queries.
- **3__Text_to_speech.py**: Converts text to spoken audio using the `pyttsx3` library, ideal for accessibility or automation tasks.
- **4__Pie_chart.py**: Creates a pie chart visualizing the popularity of programming languages in 2025 using `matplotlib`, based on data from index.dev.
- **5__Coloroued_bar_graph.py**: Generates a colored bar graph of programming language popularity in 2025 using `matplotlib`, with data from index.dev.
- **6__Animated_scatter_plot.py**: Produces an animated scatter plot with randomly moving points using `matplotlib` and `numpy`, demonstrating dynamic visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ThreeFistfulsofFigs/python-snippets
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   cd python-snippets
   ```

3. Install required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Required libraries include:
   - `captcha`: For CAPTCHA image generation.
   - `ipwhois`: For WHOIS data retrieval.
   - `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech conversion.
   - `matplotlib`: For data visualization (pie charts, bar graphs, scatter plots).
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations in animations.

## Usage

- Browse the snippets in the repository folder.
- Run individual files using Python (e.g., `python 1__Image_captcha_generator.py`).
- Modify the code as needed to suit your project requirements.
- Ensure dependencies are installed for each snippet (refer to `requirements.txt`).

## Notes

- **Version**: 1.1.0 (Updated to reflect added snippets and improved documentation).
- **Locale**: Defaults to US English formatting; adjust for other regions if necessary.
